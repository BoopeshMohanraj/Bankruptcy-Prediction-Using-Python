## Introduction
Bankruptcy prediction is crucial for risk mitigation and financial stability. This project develops machine learning models to classify companies as bankrupt or non-bankrupt using financial data.

---

## Dataset Overview
- **Class Imbalance:** 220 bankrupt cases, 6,599 non-bankrupt cases.
- **Clean Data:** No missing or duplicate values.
- **Features:** Financial ratios and metrics such as debt ratios, liabilities, and equity measures.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Target Distribution
The dataset is highly imbalanced, with bankrupt cases forming a minority class.

## Model Comparison and Results

- **XGBoost** emerged as the best-performing model with:
  - Highest accuracy (83.26%)
  - Highest ROC-AUC (0.9647)
  - Balanced precision (0.965) and recall (0.6902)
- Chose to prioritize both accuracy and recall as accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced datasets, but recall shows the true positive rate.
