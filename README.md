## Introduction
Bankruptcy prediction is crucial for risk mitigation and financial stability. This project develops machine learning models to classify companies as bankrupt or non-bankrupt using financial data.

---

## Dataset Overview
- **Class Imbalance:** 220 bankrupt cases, 6,599 non-bankrupt cases.
- **Clean Data:** No missing or duplicate values.
- **Features:** Financial ratios and metrics such as debt ratios, liabilities, and equity measures.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Target Distribution
The dataset is highly imbalanced, with bankrupt cases forming a minority class.

## Top Correlated Features

### Exploration of Top 10 Most Correlated Features to Target
1. **Debt Ratio %**
   - Highly correlated with bankruptcy.
   - Skewed distribution with concentrated values.
   - ![Debt Ratio Pairplot](images/debt_ratio_pairplot.png)

2. **Current Liability to Assets**
   - Indicates liability proportion relative to assets.
   - Strongly associated with bankruptcy.
   - ![Current Liability to Assets Pairplot](images/current_liability_assets_pairplot.png)

3. **Borrowing Dependency**
   - Reflects reliance on borrowed funds.
   - Key differentiator for bankruptcy cases.

4. **Current Liability to Current Assets**
   - Measures the ratio of current liabilities to current assets.
   - Affects the financial health of firms.

5. **Liability to Equity**
   - Measures leverage.
   - Displays notable clustering for bankrupt firms.
   - ![Liability to Equity Pairplot](images/liability_to_equity_pairplot.png)

6. **Current Liabilities to Equity**
   - Indicates the proportion of current liabilities compared to equity.
   - A significant predictor of financial instability.
   - ![Current Liabilities to Equity Pairplot](images/current_liabilities_to_equity_pairplot.png)

7. **Current Liability to Equity**
   - Similar to the previous feature, focused specifically on equity utilization.

8. **Liability-Assets Flag**
   - Binary feature indicating whether liabilities exceed assets.
   - ![Liability Assets Flag Pairplot](images/liability_assets_flag_pairplot.png)

9. **Total Expense to Assets**
   - Indicates asset efficiency in managing expenses.
   - Positively linked with bankruptcy.
   - ![Total Expense to Assets Pairplot](images/total_expense_assets_pairplot.png)

10. **Equity to Long-term Liability**
    - Captures the ratio of equity to long-term liabilities.
    - Highlights a company's ability to manage long-term debt.

### Metrics
The following table summarizes the performance metrics for each model:

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall  | F1 Score | ROC AUC  |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|---------|----------|----------|
| Random Forest       | 0.7848   | 0.9619    | 0.5932  | 0.7338   | 0.9561   |
| Decision Tree       | 0.7746   | 0.9220    | 0.6000  | 0.7269   | 0.7746   |
| XGBoost             | 0.8326   | 0.9650    | 0.6902  | 0.8048   | 0.9647   |

## Model Comparison and Results

- **XGBoost** emerged as the best-performing model with:
  - Highest accuracy (83.26%)
  - Highest ROC-AUC (0.9647)
  - Balanced precision (0.965) and recall (0.6902)
- Chose to prioritize both accuracy and recall as accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced datasets, but recall shows the true positive rate.
